Here are some general steps to troubleshoot a laptop that isn't working correctly:

---

### **1. Observe the Symptoms**

* Is it not turning on at all?
* Is it slow, freezing, or crashing?
* Are there error messages or unusual noises?
* Is the display blank or distorted?

---

### **2. Check the Power**

* **Ensure the battery is charged** or **plug in the power adapter**.
* **Try a different power outlet** or **adapter** if available.
* Look for **charging/power LED indicators**.

---

### **3. Perform a Hard Reset**

* Power off the laptop.
* Unplug the charger and remove the battery (if possible).
* Hold the power button for **15–30 seconds**, then reconnect and try again.

---

### **4. Check the Display**

* Make sure **brightness isn't turned all the way down**.
* Try connecting to an **external monitor** to check if the issue is with the screen.

---

### **5. Boot into Safe Mode**

* Try booting into **Safe Mode (Windows)** or **macOS Safe Boot** to load minimal drivers and isolate software issues.

---

### **6. Check for Overheating**

* Feel for **heat** or **listen for fans**.
* Clean **air vents** and make sure the **fans spin**.

---

### **7. Run Diagnostics**

* Use built-in diagnostics:

  * Dell: F12 on boot → Diagnostics
  * HP: Esc → F2 for system diagnostics
  * Mac: Hold D on startup

---

### **8. Check for Hardware Issues**

* Test with a **different charger**, **RAM**, or **hard drive** if possible.
* Listen for **beeps** or look for **blinking LEDs** (they often indicate hardware codes).

---

### **9. Scan for Malware and Updates**

* Boot into Safe Mode and run antivirus scans.
* Update the OS and drivers if possible.

---

### **10. Restore or Reset System**

* Use **System Restore**, **macOS Recovery**, or a **factory reset** as a last resort if software issues persist.
